# Compatibility

**Android Version:**
Wellbeing App is designed to target Android 12 (API level 30) for optimal performance and feature integration. Please note that the notification behavior of the app may not work as expected if your device is not running Android 12 (API level 30) or earlier.

**Device Screen Size Consideration:**
The app's design is tailored to the screen size of the Pixel 4 XL. While it should adapt well to various screen sizes, it was primarily crafted for an optimal experience on devices with a similar screen size.

**Notification Settings:**
Additionally, make sure that notifications are enabled both from the Android notification drawer and your device settings. To enable notifications, navigate to your device's settings, select "Apps" or "Application Manager," find Wellbeing App, and ensure that notifications are enabled. Also, double-check the notification settings within the app drawer to guarantee a smooth experience.
